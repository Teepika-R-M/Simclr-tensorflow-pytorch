# Simclr-tensorflow-pytorch

Two notebooks are attached in the repository to implement the Simclr Algorithm and visualizations are included to record how Training loss & accuracy gets improved with every epoch. Detailed comments are also included for each step implemented in the colab notebooks.

1) Simclr_Tensorflow - Simclr Implementation in Tensorflow framework
2) Simclr_Pytorch - Simclr Implementation in Pytorch framework
